# Sunspot_MagneticField_WFA
This code was written in summer 2019 for a short summer project. The idea is to infer the magnetic field variation over a sunspot at photospheric and chromospheric hiegths, from the spectral images of a sunspot. Weak field approximation is used and the theory is from the paper : Rebecca Centeno 2018 ApJ 866 89.
